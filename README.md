# lttac_chatterbot
A French chatbot capable of helping out new students of the LTTAC Master's degree (Lille, France). It's based on the Chatterbot module and is launched in the browser with flask. 

The training set is rich in French LTTAC-specific terms, which evolve around lexicography, terminology and NLP. A bot trained in such a manner must be able to answer any question that a lexico-newbie can have.
