# lttac_chatterbot
A French chatbot capable of helping out new students of the LTTAC Master's degree (Lille, France). It's launched in the browser with flask and is based on the Chatterbot module: https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot. 

The training set is rich in French LTTAC-specific terms, which evolve around lexicography, terminology and NLP. A bot trained in such a manner must be able to answer any question that a lexico-newbie can have.
